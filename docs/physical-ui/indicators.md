# Indicators

Document LEDs, displays, buzzers, and their meanings.

- Indicator mapping (color/state → meaning).
- Priority levels and escalation rules (flash patterns, audible alarms).
- Dependency on telemetry (e.g., loss of link → flashing amber).
- Night/low-light considerations.

Add alarm acknowledgement steps if applicable.
