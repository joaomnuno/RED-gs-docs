# Button Panel

Map each button/switch to its function and safeguards.

- Layout diagram or photo reference.
- Actions triggered, debounce/filtering strategy, and required confirmations.
- Interaction with software interlocks and permissions.
- Failure modes (stuck button, switch mismatch) and detection.

Provide a quick reference table operators can print and tape to the panel.
