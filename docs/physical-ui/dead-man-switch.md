# Dead-Man Switch

Detail the dead-man switch (DMS) behavior and rationale.

- Electrical implementation and monitored signals.
- Timing parameters (hold duration, timeout to safe state).
- What systems it enables/holds safe.
- Test procedure before each operation.
- Behavior under power loss or network loss.

This is a key safety element—cross-reference `safety/interlocks.md`.
