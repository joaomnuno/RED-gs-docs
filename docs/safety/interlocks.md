# Interlocks

Describe hardware and software interlocks that enforce safe behavior.

- Physical interlocks (relays, keyed switches, dead-man).
- Logical interlocks (state checks, multi-party confirmation).
- Arming logic and inhibit paths.
- Health monitoring and fail-open vs. fail-closed rationale.

Document test procedures for each interlock path.
