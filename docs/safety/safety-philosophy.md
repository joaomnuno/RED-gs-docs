# Safety Philosophy

State the principles that govern all safety decisions.

- Default-to-safe: how the system behaves when uncertain or degraded.
- Human-in-the-loop: when human confirmation is required and why.
- Independence: separation of command, telemetry, and safety circuits.
- Evidence: how safety claims are verified (tests, inspections, analysis).

Use this section to align reviewers on intent before diving into details.
