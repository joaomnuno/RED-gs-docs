# Interfaces

Physical and electrical interfaces to external systems.

- Connectors, pinouts, and signaling levels.
- Controlled outputs (valves, igniters, pumps) with maximum ratings.
- Sensor/telemetry inputs and expected ranges.
- Safety interlocks on each path (e.g., relay enable, fuse, current limit).

Use tables for pin maps and reference detailed wiring in `wiring.md`.
