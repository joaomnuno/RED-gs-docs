# Hardware Architecture

High-level physical architecture of the groundstation.

- Core compute, I/O cards, and safety hardware.
- External interfaces (vehicle umbilical, sensors, pad control, LAN).
- Segmentation rationale (what is isolated and why).
- Include or link a block diagram (`diagrams/system-block-diagram.md`).

State design assumptions and constraints (power input range, enclosure rating, environmental limits).
