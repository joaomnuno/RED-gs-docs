# Power System

Describe power sources, regulation, and monitoring.

- Input sources (battery, AC mains PSU) and selection strategy.
- Regulation chain with nominal/current limits and protections.
- Power domains and what each feeds (compute, relays, UI, radios).
- Power quality monitoring and thresholds for alarms/shutdown.
- Procedures for brown-out or over-voltage conditions.

Include a power-flow diagram in `diagrams/power-flow.md`.
