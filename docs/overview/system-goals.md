# System Goals

Document what success looks like for the groundstation.

- Functional goals (e.g., maintain telemetry link, issue arming/abort, log data).
- Performance targets (latency, uptime, power budget, network bandwidth).
- Human factors goals (single-person operation? two-person verification?).
- Safety goals (fail-safe behaviors, physical overrides).
- Verification goals (what tests prove each requirement is met).
