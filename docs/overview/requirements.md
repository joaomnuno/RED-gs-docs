# Requirements

Capture top-level requirements with clear IDs to trace through design, tests, and operations.

| ID | Requirement | Rationale | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-GS-001 |  |  |  |
| REQ-GS-002 |  |  |  |

Guidance:
- Keep requirements testable and unambiguous.
- Tag related risks or hazards and reference mitigation pages in `safety/`.
- Note requirement status (draft, baseline, retired) as revisions progress.
