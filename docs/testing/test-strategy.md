# Test Strategy

Define how the groundstation is verified from unit level to acceptance.

- Objectives: demonstrate safety, reliability, and performance.
- Levels: unit, integration, hardware-in-the-loop, field.
- Environments: lab vs. pad vs. dry-runs with simulated vehicle.
- Entry/exit criteria and documentation requirements.

Link specific tests to requirements for traceability.
