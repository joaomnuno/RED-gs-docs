# Software Tests

Tests for services and data flows.

- Unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
- Simulation of telemetry/command paths with expected responses.
- Fault injection (network loss, sensor faults) and expected safe behavior.
- Performance tests (latency, throughput).

Document test automation and manual steps separately.
