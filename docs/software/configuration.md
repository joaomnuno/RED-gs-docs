# Configuration

Describe how configuration is stored, applied, and versioned.

- File locations, formats, and default values.
- Secrets handling (credentials, tokens) and rotation plan.
- Environment-specific overrides (lab, field, competition).
- Configuration change process and rollback steps.

Document how operators confirm the active configuration before operations.
