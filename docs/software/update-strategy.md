# Update Strategy

How the groundstation software is updated without breaking operations.

- Update channels (stable/testing) and versioning scheme.
- Deployment method (packages, containers, Ansible, manual scripts).
- Pre-flight checks and post-update validation.
- Rollback mechanisms and how to verify integrity.
- Maintenance windows and who approves updates.
